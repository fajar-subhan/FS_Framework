<!-- ABOUT THE FS Framework -->
## About The FS Framework

<img src="https://github.com/fajar-subhan/FS_Framework/blob/master/assets/images/readme/icon.png" alt="Product Name Screen Shot" style="width:100%"></a>
 
FS Framework is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people building websites using PHP. Its goal is to allow you to develop projects faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich collection of libraries for common tasks required, as well as a simple interface and logistical structure to access these libraries. With only basic OOP PHP and MVC you can use this framework

## Server Requirements
PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.4.8 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.

### Built With

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
